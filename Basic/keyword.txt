Words with the superscript 1 are contextual keywords, which have meaning only in specific places.They’re valid identifiers everywhere.

Words with the superscript 2 are built-in identifiers. These keywords are valid identifiers in most places, but they can’t be used as class or type names, or as import prefixes.

Words with the superscript 3 are limited reserved words related to asynchrony support. You can’t use await or yield as an identifier in any function body marked with async, async*, or sync*.
